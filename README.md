# Minion Tranlation app

A fun translation app made in Html and CSS using a Minion API - https://funtranslations.com/minion

It converts the user input into a Minion version of that text as an output

In this project I get to learn 
1. how API's work
2. how server work
3. how to use postman to test a query
